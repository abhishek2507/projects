# projects
This is my main project repositry which consists of all the important projects completed or in ongoing status.
1) The first project in the repo consists of a speech recognition model which will be hosted on django and the speech or recorded voice file will be sended to the backend processed and to be sent to a frontend where the  voice or audio will be shown in form of text.
Using RNN with long term dependencies could be problematic if the needed past relevant data gap is minimum , using LSTMS could be more appropriate.
Linking neural network or ML based backend to frontend becomes easier using DJANGO compared to MongoDB because of the python dependency of the overall project.
